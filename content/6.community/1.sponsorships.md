XyraPanel is fully community funded. Sponsorships keep hosting online, and let contributors treat the project like a sustainable gig rather than a weekend hobby.

## Why sponsor?

This is a community project. Sponsoring helps with:

- Paying maintainers so releases, and fixes
- Covering hosting and ops (domains, CDN, preview builds, CI minutes)
- Keeping an emergency/bounty pot ready for CVEs or bug hunts
- Taking care of community moderators
