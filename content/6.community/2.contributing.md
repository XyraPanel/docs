XyraPanel grows through community input. Contributions of all types are welcome: fixes, features, documentation, test coverage, examples, and issue reports. Before getting started, review the repository **README** and scan open issues to avoid duplication.

## Core principles

- Keep work scoped to a single problem.
- Communicate clearly and stay focused on the topic.
- Follow the project’s conventions for style, tests, commits, and PR structure.

## Commit Conventions

We follow **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** to keep history structured and changelogs automated.

- `fix:` and `feat:` are reserved for changes that modify behavior or logic.
- Non-functional changes use `docs:` or `chore:`.  
  Example:
  - Wrong: `fix: typo`
  - Correct: `docs: fix typo`
- Use scopes to indicate the area affected (e.g., `auth`, `admin`, `ui`, `api`).  
  Example:  
  `feat(auth): add user token validator`
- PR titles must also follow these conventions.
- All PRs will be finalized by the project maintainer.

## Code & documentation standards

- Match the existing code style and ESLint rules.
- Provide tests for new features or bug fixes when appropriate.
- Update documentation for any user facing modification.
- Use descriptive branch names like `fix/312-sync-headers` or `feat/auth-oauth-flow`.

### Formatting rules

This project **does not use Prettier**.  
ESLint handles formatting.  
Disable Prettier in your editor to avoid unwanted changes.  
Use the following to format:

- `pnpm run lint:fix`

## Local workflow

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Create a branch:  
   `git checkout -b <type>/<short-description>`
3. Implement your change and add tests when needed.
4. Run linting, type checks, and tests (see README).
5. Build locally when relevant.

## Pull requests

1. Push your branch and open a PR targeting `main` (or the branch specified in the issue).
2. Your PR description must include:
   - What the change does
   - Why it was made
   - Steps to reproduce (for bug fixes)
   - How to test it
   - Migration notes (if any)
3. Link related issues.
4. Ensure CI, linting, and type checks pass.
5. Stay available for follow up questions.
6. **All PRs are finalized by a project maintainer**, who determines the merge method (squash, rebase, or standard merge).

## PR checklist

- [ ] Issue exists or discussion occurred
- [ ] Branch name follows conventions
- [ ] Tests added or updated
- [ ] CI, lint, and type checks succeed
- [ ] Docs updated if needed
- [ ] Commits follow Conventional Commits
- [ ] PR includes testing steps

## Reporting issues

When opening an issue:

- Search for existing reports first.
- Provide a clear title and minimal reproduction.
- Include logs, environment details, version numbers, and relevant config.
- If possible, link a small test repo or sandbox.
- Explain expected behavior, actual behavior, and severity.

## Significant or breaking work

For large changes:

- Open an issue or proposal before starting.
- Include an outline, migration notes, and release implications.
- Draft PRs are welcome for early feedback.

## Licensing

By submitting contributions, you confirm you have the right to do so and that your work will be published under the project’s MIT license.

## Getting started

Issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` are suitable entry points.  
Maintainers respond as time allows.
