## Support Expectations

XyraPanel is MIT-licensed open source. **Nobody is obligated to provide support.**

- Do not spam maintainers or contributors for help
- Do not demand responses or fixes
- If people want to help, they will
- **Read the documentation first**

Running a game panel requires knowledge and understanding. We're here to patch bugs, take feedback, and improve the software not teach you everything 24/7. Do your research and read the docs before asking for help.

## Expected Conduct

If you're running a game panel, we expect professional behavior.

- Act like you're running a business, not a playground
- Be respectful, direct, and constructive
- No childish behavior, tantrums, or drama
- Take responsibility for your setup and issues
- No harassment, discrimination, or toxicity
- Disagreements are fine, personal attacks are not

## Security Vulnerabilities

**Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly.** Use GitHub's private security reporting system, not the public issues page.

- Provide clear details and reproduction steps
- Do not exploit or abuse vulnerabilities
- Do not share vulnerabilities until they are patched
- Allow reasonable time for the team to address the issue

## Reporting Issues

- Search existing issues first
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Include relevant system info and logs
- Don't bump or spam issues for attention

These standards apply across all XyraPanel community networks. Violations may result in removal from community spaces.
