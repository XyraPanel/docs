:::accordion-item{label="What is XyraPanel?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
XyraPanel is an open-source game management panel in the same space as Pterodactyl.
Instead of following the Laravel setup used by Pterodactyl, XyraPanel is built with Nuxt.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Which games can I manage with XyraPanel?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
XyraPanel supports popular servers like Minecraft, CS:GO, Valheim, and more. It uses the same Pterodactyl egg files and yolks for games and software, making it easy to add custom servers via configuration files.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Can I migrate from other panels?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Yes. Migration guides and tools are provided to help move servers and users from panels like Pterodactyl or Pelican with minimal downtime.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Does XyraPanel support the Blueprint framework?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
No. Blueprint was designed for Pterodactyl. XyraPanel is a completely different stack with its own architecture and plugin system.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Does XyraPanel provide an API?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Yes.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Where can I get support?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Support is available via official documentation, GitHub discussions, Discord community, and forums. Contributions are welcome.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Does it work with Pterodactyl Wings?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Yes. XyraPanel runs on the same Wings Daemon, so existing Wings hosts work out of the box.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="Can I run this commercially / what’s the license?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
Yes. XyraPanel is MIT licensed.
:::

:::accordion-item{label="What hardware do I need for the panel server?" icon="i-lucide-circle-help"}
A single VPS with 2 vCPUs, 4 GB RAM, and SSD storage is plenty for the panel itself. Wings/daemon nodes should follow your game workload requirements (CPU-heavy for Minecraft, fast NVMe for modded servers, etc.).
