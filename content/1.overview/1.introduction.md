  description: Learn what XyraPanel is, why it exists, and what makes it different from older panels.
---

XyraPanel is a game management panel like **_[Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/)_**, except built with newer tech and community expectations in mind.
The project exists because many of us were tired of slow updates, blocked community ideas, and outdated tooling while the rest of the internet proceeded with progression.

## What makes XyraPanel different?

Instead of taking the Laravel route like _Pterodactyl and Pelican,_ **XyraPanel** is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and
[Nitro](https://nitro.dev/) which are modern frameworks with large communities and active development by the community. Nitro uses [H3](https://h3.dev/) under the hood, which is 
a lightning fast web server written in pure Typescript.

Nuxt provides XyraPanel with the Client & Server Side Rendering (SSR) out of the box, Nitro is used in under the hood, but it also provides XyraPanel with the abilities 
for server tasks, Redis caching, Websockets, and much more.

For the applications database, XyraPanel uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) which is a Typescript ORM with type safety,

Authenication is handled by [NuxtAuth](https://auth.sidebase.io/) which also provides us with Middleware, Rest API, Refresh Tokens, Oauth, and more.
