  description: Learn what XyraPanel is, why it exists, and what makes it different from older panels.

> XyraPanel is a game management panel similar to **_[Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/)_**, but built with modern technologies and today’s community expectations in mind.
> The project started because many of us were frustrated with slow updates, rejected community ideas,
> and outdated tooling while the rest of the internet continued to move forward.

## What makes XyraPanel different?

Instead of following the traditional Laravel route used by _Pterodactyl_ and _Pelican_, **XyraPanel** is built with [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) and [Nitro](https://nitro.dev/).
These are modern, actively maintained frameworks backed by large communities.
Nitro uses [H3](https://h3.dev/) under the hood which is a lightning-fast web server written entirely in TypeScript.

Nuxt gives XyraPanel built-in Client & Server Side Rendering (SSR), while Nitro powers server operations such as task handling, Redis caching, WebSockets, and more. For database management, XyraPanel uses [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), a type-safe TypeScript ORM designed for modern applications.
Authentication is handled by [NuxtAuth](https://auth.sidebase.io/), which provides middleware, REST API support, refresh tokens, OAuth, and other essential auth features.

## Why another panel?

While there are many game panels available, the majority are simply forks of Pterodactyl. In most cases these forks are designed around paywalls, SAAS subscriptions, restrictive licenses, or practices that feel questionable.

XyraPanel aims to set a new standard: fully open source under MIT, built on a modern tech stack, and genuinely driven by the community.
We believe the community’s voice matters and ignoring it is exactly what led to the downfall of many panels in the past.
